# CAPM
One of the most widely used methods of calculating the required rate is the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). Under the CAPM, the rate is determined using the following formula:

RRR = rf + ß(rm – rf)
Where:

RRR – required rate of return
rf – risk-free rate
ß – beta coefficient of an investment
rm – return of a market
The CAPM framework adjusts the required rate of return for an investment’s level of risk (measured by the beta) and inflation (assuming that the risk-free rate is adjusted for the inflation level).

Another method of calculating the required rate is the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC). The WACC approach is frequently utilized in corporate finance. Unlike the CAPM, the WACC takes into consideration the capital structure of a company. Due to this, the required rate obtained from the WACC is used in the corporate decision-making process of undertaking new projects. It can be calculated using the following formula:

RRR = wDrD(1 – t) + were
Where:

wD – weight of debt
rD – cost of debt
t – corporate tax rate
we – weight of equity
re – cost of equity
The WACC determines the overall cost of the company’s financing. Therefore, the WACC can be viewed as a break-even return that determines the profitability of a project or an investment decision.

# Dividend growth formula
DGR = [(Recent dividend (D2) - Previous dividend (D1)) x 100] / Previous dividend. Compounded method formula: Where Dp is the company's dividend value for a specific period (p), Dq is the company's dividend value for the initial period (q), and n is the time difference between p and q.
